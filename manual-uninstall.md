# Manual uninstall (escape hatch)

Normally you remove glocker with:

```bash
sudo glocker -uninstall "<reason>"
```

This page is the **fallback** for when that can't run — the daemon is dead, the
config is gone, there's no terminal for the typing gate, or the binary is broken.
It reverts everything by hand instead of through glocker.

Everything here needs **root**. That's by design: glocker restricts your `sudo`
during blocked windows, and a determined removal shouldn't be a one-keystroke
reflex. Root is still reachable — it's just not the `sudo` shortcut.

## Step 0 — become root

In rough order of least disruption:

1. **Wait for your allowed sudo window**, then `sudo -i`. No reboot. Use this
   for anything that isn't urgent.
2. **Recovery mode.** Reboot, pick the recovery / "Advanced options" entry in
   GRUB, drop to a root shell. Always works unless GRUB itself is
   password-protected — but you lose your session. This is the "it's broken and I
   can't wait" path.
3. **`su -`** — only if the root account has a password you set (on most desktop
   installs it's locked, so this won't work).

`sudo` being blocked mid-window is *not* a lockout: options 2 and 3 don't go
through sudoers.

## Step 1 — stop the daemon

It re-applies everything (immutable flags, hosts, sudoers) every ~60s, so stop it
first or your edits get overwritten:

```bash
systemctl stop glocker glockpeek
systemctl disable glocker glockpeek
```

The unit files are immutable, but stopping and disabling a service doesn't touch
the file, so this still works. (`Restart=always` only re-runs a *crashed*
service; an explicit `stop` stays stopped.)

## Step 2 — clear the immutable flags

glocker marks these files immutable (`chattr +i`) so a quick edit won't stick.
Clear them before you can edit or remove them:

```bash
chattr -i /etc/hosts \
          /etc/glocker/config.yaml \
          /usr/local/bin/glocker \
          /usr/local/bin/glocklock \
          /etc/systemd/system/glocker.service
```

"No such file" for anything already gone is fine — ignore it.

## Step 3 — restore /etc/hosts

glocker's block is appended at the end of the file, starting at its marker.
Delete from that marker to the end:

```bash
sed -i '/### GLOCKER START ###/,$d' /etc/hosts
```

Then confirm nothing of yours lived below it (it never should):

```bash
grep GLOCKER /etc/hosts || echo "hosts is clean"
```

## Step 4 — restore sudoers

So your normal `sudo` works again. Prefer glocker's backup; always go through
`visudo` so you can't save a broken file (a broken `/etc/sudoers` breaks `sudo`
for everyone):

```bash
# If the backup exists and is valid, use it:
visudo -c -f /etc/sudoers.glocker.backup && cp /etc/sudoers.glocker.backup /etc/sudoers

# Otherwise edit by hand and delete the line ending in "# GLOCKER-MANAGED":
visudo
```

## Step 5 — remove glocker's files

```bash
rm -f /usr/local/bin/glocker /usr/local/bin/glocklock \
      /usr/local/bin/glockpeek /usr/local/bin/glockdoc
rm -f /etc/systemd/system/glocker.service /etc/systemd/system/glockpeek.service
rm -f /etc/cron.d/glocker-doc          # the glockdoc heartbeat cron
rm -f /etc/sudoers.glocker.backup
rm -f /tmp/glocker.sock
rm -rf /etc/glocker
systemctl daemon-reload
```

Optional leftovers (just logs and browser bits, harmless to keep):

```bash
rm -f /var/log/glocker-*.log /var/log/glocker-*.jsonl
# Firefox: remove the glocker extension from your profile
# GNOME:   rm -rf ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/glocker-usage@glocker.app
```

## Step 6 — verify

```bash
pgrep -a glocker || echo "no glocker processes"
lsattr /etc/hosts                       # no 'i' in the flags
grep GLOCKER /etc/hosts || echo "hosts clean"
sudo -v && echo "sudo works"            # run outside a blocked window
```

If all four look right, glocker is fully removed.
