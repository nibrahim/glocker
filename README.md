# Glocker

A Linux-based distraction blocking system that uses multiple enforcement mechanisms to help you stay focused.

## Why Glocker?

I needed an application that would block distracting sites and apps, but existing solutions didn't work for me:
- **Plucky** wasn't transparent about its strategies and didn't support Firefox
- **Accountable2You** couldn't get it working on Linux

Given the control that Linux offers for `root`, it's hard to make something that *really* blocks everything. However, it is possible to make it very tedious to break out. That's what this application does.

I've often found that there are liminal moments where I make the wrong decision in a fog of distraction. Having someone, or if not possible, something that makes it hard to make the wrong decision, lets me get back to work.

That's what Glocker tries to do.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Build all binaries
make build-all

# Install as systemd service (requires sudo)
sudo ./glocker -install

# Check status
glocker -status

# Uninstall
sudo glocker -uninstall "reason for uninstalling"
```

## What It Does

Glocker uses **8 independent monitoring systems** that work together:

1. **Hosts File Blocking** - Redirects blocked domains to `127.0.0.1`
2. **Web Tracking** - Intercepts HTTP/HTTPS requests, records violations
3. **Browser Extension** - Monitors page content for forbidden keywords
4. **Forbidden Programs** - Kills specified programs during time windows
5. **Violation Tracking** - Triggers actions when threshold exceeded (e.g., screen lock)
6. **Sudoers Control** - Restricts `sudo` access during blocking periods
7. **Tamper Detection** - Self-healing when critical files are modified
8. **Panic Mode** - Emergency system suspension with re-suspend on early wake

Each system can be independently enabled/disabled and configured with time windows for fine-grained control.

## Architecture

Glocker is three cooperating processes:

- **`glocker`** — the privileged agent. Does the enforcement and data
  collection: usage monitoring, `/etc/hosts` management, sudoers control, killing
  forbidden programs, mindful uninstalls, processing local commands (`-block`,
  `-unblock`, …), and running the local web server the browser extension reports
  violations into. It records everything to log files under `/var/log/`.
- **`glockpeek`** — the stats service and web dashboard, a **separate process**
  (its own systemd service, localhost only). It reads the same
  `/etc/glocker/config.yaml`, reads the logs directly, and serves the dashboard
  at the root (default `http://127.0.0.1:4317/`). The glocker daemon no
  longer serves the dashboard itself.
- **`glockdoc`** — the watchdog. Runs periodically and records whether glocker is
  alive to a heartbeat log, and is **deliberately left in place by an uninstall**
  so a silent teardown is still recorded.

`glocker` and `glockdoc` watch the machine locally; `glockpeek` reads and
displays. The longer-term direction — glocker syncing to a local *or hosted*
glockpeek, mutual glocker/glockdoc monitoring, end-to-end encryption, and an
open-core hosted tier — is captured in [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md).

## Key Features

- **Time-Based Blocking** - Block sites only during work hours
- **Temporary Unblocking** - Unblock domains for short periods with logged reasons
- **Program Extensions** - Mark a forbidden program `extendible: true` to allow `glocker -extend` to grant a one-hour reprieve for legitimate edge cases (e.g. an unplanned evening business call); capped at one grant per rolling 24 hours, persisted across daemon restarts, logged and emailed
- **Allow Windows for Programs** - In addition to `kill_windows`, programs can be configured with `allow_windows` (killed outside the listed times) for inverse semantics
- **Accountability** - Email notifications to partner on violations, unblocks, and extension grants
- **DNS Cache Flushing** - Configured browsers (`kill_on_block`) are killed right after `glocker -block` applies, forcing a fresh lookup so a newly blocked domain isn't still reachable from a browser's internal DNS cache
- **Lifecycle Logging** - Install and uninstall events are recorded with a required reason and optional note; valid reasons are gated by config
- **Content Monitoring** - Firefox extension watches for keywords on any page
- **Screen Locker** - Time-based or text-based mindful unlocking
- **Stats Dashboard** - Web dashboard (`glockpeek`) with violations, clean streaks, usage analytics, and exposure patterns
- **Panic Mode** - Nuclear option: suspend system and re-suspend on early wake

## Utilities

- **[glocker](cmd/glocker/)** - Main daemon and CLI (enforcement + data collection)
- **[glockpeek](cmd/glockpeek/)** - Standalone stats web dashboard; serves on localhost (default `:4317`), reading the logs
- **[glockdoc](cmd/glockdoc/)** - Liveness watchdog; records whether glocker is running (survives uninstall)
- **[glocklock](cmd/glocklock/)** - X11 screen locker with time/text-based modes

## Example Configuration

```yaml
domains:
  # Always blocked (permanent - default)
  - {name: "reddit.com"}

  # Always blocked, but can be temporarily unblocked
  - {name: "youtube.com", unblockable: true}

  # Time-based blocking - only blocked during the listed windows
  - name: "twitter.com"
    block_windows:
      - start: "09:00"
        end: "17:00"
        days: ["Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri"]

# Kill programs during the listed windows
forbidden_programs:
  programs:
    # Killed during the window (use kill_windows for "blocked during these hours")
    - name: "chromium"
      kill_windows:
        - start: "20:00"
          end: "05:00"
          days: ["Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri"]

    # Allowed only during the window (use allow_windows for "permitted during these hours")
    - name: "steam"
      allow_windows:
        - start: "19:00"
          end: "22:00"
          days: ["Fri", "Sat"]

    # Extendible: `glocker -extend firefox "client call"` grants one hour,
    # max once per rolling 24 hours.
    - name: "firefox"
      extendible: true
      kill_windows:
        - start: "22:00"
          end: "05:00"
          days: ["Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri", "Sat", "Sun"]

# Browsers cache DNS internally, so a domain freshly added via `glocker -block`
# stays reachable until they restart. Kill them on every -block to force a
# fresh lookup against the updated /etc/hosts. Ignores time windows and is not
# counted as a violation.
kill_on_block:
  - firefox
  - chromium
  - brave

# Lifecycle accountability: -uninstall must cite one of these reasons
lifecycle:
  log_file: "/var/log/glocker-lifecycle.log"
  reasons: ["maintenance", "hardware", "testing"]

# Lock screen after 5 violations in 60 minutes
violation_tracking:
  enabled: true
  max_violations: 5
  time_window_minutes: 60
  command: "glocklock -duration 5m"
```

**Domain Blocking Behavior:**
- **No time windows** → Always blocked (permanent by default)
- **Time windows specified** → Only blocked during those time windows
- **`unblockable: true`** → Domain can be temporarily unblocked (otherwise permanent)

See [sample config](conf/conf.yaml) and [configuration guide](docs/config.md) for all options.

## Command Examples

```bash
# Inspection
glocker -status          # Runtime state: blocked count, temp unblocks,
                         # active program extensions, recent violations,
                         # panic mode
glocker -info            # Static configuration: domains, programs,
                         # time windows, keywords

# Domain management
glocker -unblock "youtube.com,reddit.com:work research"
glocker -block "facebook.com,instagram.com"   # persisted to config; also kills
                                              # kill_on_block browsers to flush DNS
glocker -add-keyword "gambling,casino,poker"

# Forbidden-program management
glocker -block-app "steam,chromium"            # kill these on sight, 24/7

glocker -panic 30        # Suspend for 30 minutes

# Uninstall with accountability
sudo glocker -uninstall "maintenance" -note "kernel upgrade"
```

## Stats Dashboard (glockpeek)

`glockpeek` runs as its own systemd service and serves a web dashboard of your
exposure and usage analytics. It is **DB-backed** (SQLite locally, Postgres for a
hosted instance — via GORM, so switching is just a driver + DSN change) and
**multi-tenant** under the hood, which lets the same code run as a zero-config
personal desktop tool or as a shared/hosted instance. The glocker agent doesn't
write to the dashboard directly; a syncer pushes local records into glockpeek's
**ingest API**, so the two can live on different machines (see PLAN, untracked).

glockpeek runs in one of two modes (`glockpeek_mode`, default `local`):

**`local` (default) — personal desktop.** Binds `127.0.0.1` only (unreachable
from other hosts), no login or account to create, and the ingest endpoint is open
to same-machine clients (no token). Just run it and open the page:

```bash
glockpeek                        # uses /etc/glocker/config.yaml
xdg-open http://127.0.0.1:4317/
```

Any local user on that machine can view it — fine for a personal desktop; use
`hosted` for a shared box.

**`hosted` — shared/remote instance.** Per-account logins (httpOnly **session
cookie**) + ingest **tokens** (the syncer sends `Authorization: Bearer <token>`,
which identifies its account) + isolation. Manage accounts with admin subcommands
(they touch the DB, so run them on the DB host as the service user):

```bash
glockpeek -adduser noufal     # create a dashboard account (prompts for a password)
glockpeek -passwd  noufal     # change a password
glockpeek -addtoken noufal    # mint an ingest API token for the syncer (printed once)
```

- **Config** (`conf.yaml`): `glockpeek_mode` (`local`/`hosted`), `glockpeek_listen`
  (address, hosted mode), `database` (driver + DSN), `glockpeek_secure_cookies`
  (set true when served over HTTPS).

**How data gets there.** The glocker daemon keeps recording to its `/var` logs
(the source of truth) and enforcing offline; a **syncer** goroutine
(`sync.enabled`) mirrors new records up to glockpeek's ingest API — a one-shot
backfill at startup, then incremental on a timer. It's local-first: if glockpeek
is down the syncer just retries, and enforcement is never affected. The Data-sync
panel on the dashboard shows when the daemon last pushed. Point `sync.glockpeek_url`
at a remote host to sync off-box.

The dashboard surfaces violation totals and types, clean streaks, a
coverage/health score, per-day activity, and usage analytics (per-program
title-word breakdowns). Periods during which Glocker was uninstalled are shown as
`UNMANAGED` coverage gaps rather than silently absent.

The installed service currently runs as **root** (unprivileged operation is a
planned hardening step before self-hosting ships to others).

## Implementation

Glocker is a **Go application** that runs as a systemd service with setuid root privileges:

- **Daemon:** Runs enforcement loop every 60s, manages protections
- **CLI:** Communicates with daemon via Unix socket (`/tmp/glocker.sock`)
- **Browser Extension:** Firefox extension in [`extensions/firefox/`](extensions/firefox/)
- **Config:** YAML configuration in `/etc/glocker/config.yaml` ([sample](conf/conf.yaml))

See [architecture documentation](docs/architecture.md) for detailed design.
