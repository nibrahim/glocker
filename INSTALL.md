# Installing glocker

Glocker is a Linux tool. Installing it means editing one config file and running
one make target — but because it runs as a privileged service and makes parts of
your system immutable, it's worth understanding each step.

## Requirements

- Linux with **systemd**
- **Go 1.25+** (to build)
- **Root access** (`sudo`) — for the setuid binary, the systemd service, and the immutable files
- **Firefox** — for the content-monitoring extension
- **iptables** (optional) — for firewall-level blocking on top of the hosts file

## 1. Get the code

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nibrahim/glocker
cd glocker
```

## 2. Edit your config

Everything is driven by **`conf/conf.yaml`** — this is the single source of truth.
`make full-install` regenerates `/etc/glocker/config.yaml` from it. (Runtime
commands like `glocker -block` change things *in memory only*; for anything
permanent, edit `conf/conf.yaml`.) A fully commented reference lives in
`conf/conf.yaml.sample`.

Open `conf/conf.yaml` and set what applies to you:

| Section | What to set |
|---|---|
| `domains` | Sites to block. Add your own, and/or use the automated blocklists (step 3). |
| `forbidden_programs` | Programs to close, with `kill_windows` / `allow_windows`. |
| `sudoers` | The `user:` whose `sudo` is held back during focus hours, and the `allow_windows` when it's permitted. |
| `accountability` | Mailgun `api_key`, `from_email`, `partner_email` for the emails. Leave `enabled: false` if you don't want email. |
| `usage_monitor` | `display` (e.g. `:0`) and `xauthority` so the root daemon can see your X session for usage tracking. |
| `glockpeek_mode` | `local` (default — dashboard on `127.0.0.1:4317`, no login) or `hosted`. |
| `database` | `sqlite` by default; point at `postgres` for a hosted setup. |
| `sync` | `enabled`, `glockpeek_url`, `interval_seconds` — the agent → glockpeek sync. |
| `violation_tracking` | Screen-lock threshold and command. |
| `mindful_uninstall` | The typing-gate friction for uninstalling. |
| `lifecycle` | Allowed `-uninstall` reasons. |

Time windows follow the same `HH:MM` + `days` shape everywhere; the key name
(`block_windows` / `allow_windows` / `kill_windows`) carries the meaning.

> **Heads up:** the sample config ships with the author's personal values
> (Mailgun key, email, username, `DISPLAY`, lock command). Replace them with your
> own before installing.

## 3. (Optional) Pull the blocklists

`make full-install` does this for you, but you can populate curated blocklists
(adult content, ads, malware, proxy-bypass sites) directly:

```bash
./update_domains.py        # list the available sources
./update_domains.py all    # pull them all into conf/conf.yaml
```

## 4. Build and install

```bash
make full-install
```

This builds every binary, pulls the blocklists, and installs and starts the
services. (Under the hood: `make build-all`, then `update_domains.py all`, then
`sudo ./glocker -install`.) You'll be asked for `sudo`.

## 5. Load the Firefox extension

The content monitor is a Firefox extension in `extensions/firefox/`:

1. Open `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`
2. **Load Temporary Add-on** → choose `extensions/firefox/manifest.json`

(For a permanent install, sign it through Mozilla AMO.)

## 6. Verify

```bash
glocker -status                    # blocking state, violations, sync status
xdg-open http://127.0.0.1:4317/    # the glockpeek dashboard
```

Check that `/etc/hosts` contains the `GLOCKER` block and that a blocked domain
resolves to `127.0.0.1`.

## Everyday use

```bash
glocker -status                          # runtime state
glocker -info                            # configured domains/programs/windows
sudo glocker -unblock "youtube.com:research"   # temporary unblock, logged
sudo glocker -extend "firefox:client call"     # one-hour program grant, once/24h
sudo glocker -reload                     # reload config after editing
sudo glocker -uninstall "maintenance"    # uninstall (mindful gate, unless "maintenance")
```

## Updating

After pulling new changes, re-run:

```bash
make full-install
```
